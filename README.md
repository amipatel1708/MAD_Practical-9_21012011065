# AIM: 
* What is Frame by Frame Animation?
  
 Frame-by-frame animation changes the contents of the Stage in every frame. It is best suited to complex animation in which an image changes in every frame instead of simply moving across the Stage. Frame-by-frame animation increases file size more rapidly than tweened animation. In frame-by-frame animation, Animate stores the values for each complete frame.

* What is Twin Animation?
  
 Animation has always been about the illusion of movement. Tweening is a major part of making that illusion look real. Tweening in animation is a short for inbetweening, and it's the process of generating images that go between keyframes. 

* Create Android Application to demonstrate Frame by frame animation and splash screen to demonstrate twin animation.
